## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Daily Development
```bash
# Run tests and update tracking
npm run test:full

# Just update coverage trackers
npm run update-coverage

# Generate weekly report
npm run weekly-report
```

### For CI/CD Integration
- **Automatic**: GitHub Actions runs on every push/PR
- **Weekly**: Scheduled maintenance with automated reports
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage and test failure checks

## 📊 Tracking Systems Overview

### Test Coverage Tracker
- **22 components** tracked with current/target coverage
- **Agent assignments** for specialized work distribution
- **Priority levels** for critical path identification
- **Dependency mapping** for implementation sequencing

### Implementation Progress Tracker
- **30+ tasks** across 3 implementation phases
- **Status tracking** with completion dates
- **Blocker documentation** for issue resolution
- **Success criteria** for measurable outcomes

## 🎯 Current Status

### Coverage Gaps (Priority Order)
1. **CodeLens Providers** (6 files, 0% → 85% coverage) - **Critical**
2. **UI Components** (3 files, 0% → 80% coverage) - **High**
3. **Services** (3 files, 0% → 85% coverage) - **Medium**
4. **Integration Testing** (0% → 80% coverage) - **High**
5. **E2E Testing** (0% → 60% coverage) - **Medium**

### Failing Tests (7 total - Priority: Critical)
- `FallbackCommands.test.ts` (2 failures)
- `DependencyDetector.test.ts` (3 failures)
- `PresetManager.test.ts` (2 failures)

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Crisis Resolution ✅ Ready
**Focus**: Fix failing tests, clean infrastructure, establish patterns
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Success Criteria**: All tests passing, clean infrastructure

### Phase 2: Component Coverage ✅ Planned
**Focus**: CodeLens providers, UI components, service layer
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Success Criteria**: 85%+ unit test coverage

### Phase 3: Integration & E2E ✅ Planned
**Focus**: End-to-end workflows, CI/CD automation
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Complete testing pipeline
