# üìö Testing Documentation Maintenance Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for maintaining the testing documentation, tracking spreadsheets, and quality assurance processes for the markdown toolbar extension.

## üìä Tracking Spreadsheet Maintenance

### Test Coverage Tracker (`test-coverage-tracker.csv`)

#### When to Update
- **Daily**: After completing any test implementation work
- **Weekly**: Review and validate coverage metrics
- **After CI/CD Runs**: Update with latest coverage data
- **Before Releases**: Ensure all critical components meet targets

#### How to Update
```csv
# Required Fields
Component,File,Current_Coverage,Target_Coverage,Test_Count,Status,Priority

# Status Values
- Not_Started: No tests implemented
- In_Progress: Tests being written
- Passing: All tests passing
- Failing: Tests exist but failing
- Complete: Meets coverage target

# Priority Values
- Critical: Blocks releases (0% coverage, failing tests)
- High: Important user features (UI, providers)
- Medium: Supporting functionality
- Low: Nice-to-have coverage
```

#### Update Process
1. Run `npm run test:cov` to get latest coverage
2. Update `Current_Coverage` column with actual percentages
3. Update `Test_Count` with number of passing tests
4. Change `Status` based on completion criteria
5. Add notes in comments for blockers or issues

### Implementation Progress Tracker (`implementation-progress.csv`)

#### When to Update
- **Daily**: Task status changes and progress updates
- **End of Day**: Summary of work completed
- **Phase Transitions**: When moving between implementation phases
- **Weekly Reviews**: Assess overall progress and adjust timelines

#### How to Update
```csv
# Required Fields
Phase,Task,Component,Assigned_Agent,Status,Start_Date,Completion_Date,Blockers,Notes

# Status Values
- Not_Started: Task defined but not begun
- In_Progress: Actively working on task
- Blocked: Waiting on dependencies or issues
- Complete: Task finished successfully
- On_Hold: Temporarily paused

# Date Format
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format
- Leave Completion_Date blank for in-progress tasks
```

#### Update Process
1. Update `Status` when starting/completing tasks
2. Set `Start_Date` when beginning work
3. Set `Completion_Date` when task is done
4. Document `Blockers` with specific issues
5. Add `Notes` for important context or decisions

## üìñ Documentation Maintenance

### Implementation Plan (`docs/testing/implementation-plan.md`)

#### When to Update
- **After Major Changes**: Architecture or scope changes
- **Phase Completions**: Update progress and next steps
- **New Patterns**: When discovering better testing approaches
- **Monthly Reviews**: Assess plan effectiveness

#### How to Update
1. Update phase status sections with completion percentages
2. Add new patterns or approaches discovered during implementation
3. Update success criteria based on real-world constraints
4. Document lessons learned and improvements

### Component Strategies (`docs/testing/component-strategies.md`)

#### When to Update
- **New Components**: When adding new testable components
- **Pattern Improvements**: When finding better test approaches
- **Mock Updates**: When VS Code API changes require new mocks
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess strategy effectiveness

#### How to Update
1. Add new component sections following existing format
2. Update mock requirements based on implementation experience
3. Refine test patterns based on what works in practice
4. Update success criteria with realistic targets

### Executive Report (`docs/testing/executive-report.md`)

#### When to Update
- **Weekly**: Progress summaries and metric updates
- **Phase Transitions**: Major milestone achievements
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive status reports
- **Before Reviews**: Prepare for stakeholder discussions

#### How to Update
1. Update coverage metrics with latest data
2. Refresh risk assessments based on current blockers
3. Update expected outcomes with realistic timelines
4. Document major decisions and their rationale
