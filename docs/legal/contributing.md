## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Code Style

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export class MarkdownFormatter {
  constructor(private contextDetector: ContextDetector) {}

  formatBold(text: string): string {
    const context = this.contextDetector.detect(text);
    return this.applyBoldFormatting(text, context);
  }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
export class fmt {
  constructor(c: any) {}
  b(t: string): string {
    return '**' + t + '**';
  }
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
# Feature commits
feat: add table formatting support
feat: implement header code lens

# Bug fixes
fix: resolve crash on empty document
fix: correct regex pattern for links

# Documentation
docs: update installation guide
docs: add API reference

# Testing
test: add unit tests for formatter
test: improve integration test coverage

# Refactoring
refactor: simplify command factory
refactor: extract common utilities
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Required for all new features
- **Integration tests**: Required for command interactions
- **E2E tests**: Recommended for complex workflows

### Test Coverage

- Maintain >90% unit test coverage
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:cov

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## üìö Documentation

 * @returns Formatted text with bold markdown
 */
formatBold(text: string, context: CursorContext): string {
  // Implementation...
}
```
