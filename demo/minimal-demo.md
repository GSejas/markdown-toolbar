This document tests the **minimal preset** designed for quick note-taking and basic markdown editing.

## Testing Instructions

1. Switch to the `test-minimal` preset
2. Notice only 4 buttons are available: Bold, Italic, Heading Toggle, Preview
3. Test each feature below

## Feature Testing

### Basic Formatting

Try making this text **bold** using the toolbar button.

Try making this text *italic* using the toolbar button.

### Heading Tests

Use the heading toggle button on these lines:
This should become H1
This should become H2  
This should become H3
This should cycle back to normal text

## Sample Content to Format

Here's some plain text you can practice formatting:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's commonly used for testing fonts and keyboards.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.

### Test Scenarios

1. **Bold entire paragraphs** - Select full paragraphs and make them bold
2. **Italic specific words** - Select individual words and make them italic  
3. **Mixed formatting** - Try combining bold and italic
4. **Heading conversion** - Convert normal text to various heading levels
5. **Preview functionality** - Use side-by-side preview to see results

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Bold button should wrap/unwrap text with `**`
- ✅ Italic button should wrap/unwrap text with `*`  
- ✅ Heading toggle should cycle through H1→H2→H3→normal
- ✅ Preview button should open side preview
- ❌ Advanced features (tables, code, links) should NOT be available

## Notes for Testing

- Quick notes and journaling
- Basic document drafts
- Mobile/tablet editing (fewer buttons)

The minimal interface reduces cognitive load while providing essential formatting tools.
