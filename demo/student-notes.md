## üìö Course: Advanced Mathematics

### Lecture 1: Calculus Fundamentals

#### Key Concepts to Remember
- Derivatives represent rate of change
- Integrals represent area under curves
- Fundamental theorem connects derivatives and integrals

#### Important Formulas

The derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n-1}$

The integral of a constant $c$ is:
$$\int c \, dx = cx + C$$

#### Study Tasks
- [ ] Review derivative rules
- [ ] Practice integration by parts  
- [ ] Complete problem set 1-15
- [ ] Prepare for midterm exam
- [ ] Form study group

### Lecture 2: Optimization Problems

#### Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Identify** what needs to be optimized
2. **Set up** the constraint equations
3. **Take derivatives** to find critical points
4. **Test** the critical points
5. **Verify** the solution makes sense

#### Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** A rectangular box with square base has volume 32 cubic inches. Find dimensions that minimize surface area.

*Solution approach:*
- Let $x$ = side length of base, $h$ = height
- Constraint: $x^2 h = 32$, so $h = \frac{32}{x^2}$
- Surface area: $S = 2x^2 + 4xh$
- Substitute and optimize...

**Problem 2:** Test your math formatting tools here.

### Reading Notes

#### Chapter 5: Applications of Derivatives

**Key Points:**
- Maximum and minimum values occur at critical points
- Use first derivative test for increasing/decreasing
- Use second derivative test for concavity

**Questions for Office Hours:**
- [ ] Clarify the difference between absolute and local extrema
- [ ] Get help with related rates problems
- [ ] Review curve sketching techniques

## üß™ Science Class: Chemistry

### Lab Report: Acid-Base Titration

#### Hypothesis
Strong acid + strong base ‚Üí salt + water + heat

The reaction: $HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O$

#### Data Collection
- [ ] Record initial pH
- [ ] Measure NaOH volume at equivalence point
- [ ] Calculate molarity of unknown HCl
- [ ] Determine percent error

#### Results
*Use the table tools to create a data table here*

| Trial | Initial pH | Volume NaOH (mL) | Final pH | Molarity |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| 1     |            |                  |          |          |
| 2     |            |                  |          |          |
| 3     |            |                  |          |          |
